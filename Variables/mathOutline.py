#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
p = "8"
k = "5"
j = p + k 
print(j)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
r = 6
i = 9 
u = r + i 
print(u)


#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
q = 4 
w= 10 
t = q - w 
print(t)



#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
n = .76 
h = .22 
v = n - h 

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
y = 6 
z = 1 
b = y*z 


#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.
M = "9" 
N = 10 
Q = M * N 
print(Q) 


#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
Y = 6 
G = 2
H = Y/ G
print (H)


#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
C = 8.20
V = 4.60 
N = C / V 
print(N)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
Y = 7 
G = 2
H = Y % G
print (H)


#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
S = 36
K = 100
X = S // K
print(X)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
T = 5 
L = 9 
F = T ** L
print(F)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error
g = "5"
h = 2 
y = g % h
print (y)

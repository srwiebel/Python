#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):
a = 5 
b = 4.5
c = "paper cut" 
d = True 
e = ["apples","bananas","pears"] 
print(type(b))


#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)
a = 7
A= 10 

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:
g = 6

g = 3

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:
bear = g


#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:
n = ["tomatoes","dog","mayo"] 
k = n[1] 
print(k)
#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:
G = "sierra"
l=G[0]
print(l)
#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:
print(A)


#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors
v = 13 
print(V)
